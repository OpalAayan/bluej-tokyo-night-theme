🛠️ Installation

Download the theme

Click the green Code button on this page → Download ZIP.

Locate BlueJ’s stylesheet folder

Windows: `C:\Program Files\BlueJ\lib\stylesheets`

macOS: Right-click BlueJ → Show Package Contents → `Contents/Resources/Java/stylesheets`

Linux: Usually `/usr/share/bluej/lib/stylesheets`

Replace the files

Extract the ZIP.

Copy all .css files into the stylesheets folder.

(Optional: Back up the originals first!)

Restart BlueJ

The dark theme will now be applied.

🔮 Future Development

Some UI elements (like the text cursor and editor background) are hardcoded in BlueJ’s Java source and cannot be themed with CSS alone. A Java-based extension is planned to cover these final gaps and deliver a 100% complete theme.
