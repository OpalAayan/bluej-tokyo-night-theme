üöÄ Features
Comprehensive Theming: Styles almost every part of the UI, including menus, dialogs, buttons, the code editor, and the terminal.

Modern Aesthetics: Uses a carefully selected color palette for a clean, professional look that's easy on the eyes.

Enhanced Readability: Syntax highlighting is optimized for clarity and quick code scanning.

Easy Installation: Simply replace the default stylesheets to get started.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Download the Files: Click the green < > Code button on the main repository page and select Download ZIP.

Find Your BlueJ Stylesheets:

Windows: Navigate to C:\Program Files\BlueJ\lib\stylesheets

macOS: Right-click on the BlueJ application, select Show Package Contents, and then navigate to Contents/Resources/Java/stylesheets.

Linux: The path is typically /usr/share/bluej/lib/stylesheets or similar.

Replace the Files: Unzip the downloaded theme and copy all the .css files into the stylesheets folder, replacing the original files. (It's a good idea to back up the original files first!)

Restart BlueJ: The new theme will be active when you restart the application.

üîÆ Future Development
Some UI elements (like the text cursor and default editor background) are hard-coded into BlueJ's Java source and cannot be changed with CSS. A future Java-based extension is being considered to override these final elements and achieve a 100% complete theme.

A big thanks to Gemini for the assistance in troubleshooting and developing the CSS.
