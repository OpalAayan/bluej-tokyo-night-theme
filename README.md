In this screenshot, I‚Äôve changed the Codepad background from `#140e1a` to `#24152d` to improve cursor visibility.  
An extension is planned to properly handle this across setups.  
~I‚Äôll also upload the `java-colors.css` file soon‚Äîlet me know if you‚Äôd like a copy~ Maybe I did.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Download the theme**  
   Click the green **Code** button on this page ‚Üí **Download ZIP**.
   >NEWstylesheet.zip for latest 
   >Old one for default OG 

3. **Locate BlueJ‚Äôs stylesheet folder**
   - **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\BlueJ\lib\stylesheets`
   - **macOS:** Right-click BlueJ ‚Üí **Show Package Contents** ‚Üí `Contents/Resources/Java/stylesheets`
   - **Linux:** Usually `/usr/share/bluej/lib/stylesheets`

4. **Replace the files**
   - Extract the ZIP.  
   - Copy all `.css` files into the `stylesheets` folder.  
   - *(Optional but recommended: back up the originals first!)*

5. **Restart BlueJ**  
   The dark theme will now be applied.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Uninstall / Revert

- Replace the modified `.css` files with your backups, **or**
- Reinstall BlueJ to restore the default styles.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

- The file `java-colors.css` (to be uploaded) will expose editor/Codepad colors you can tweak (e.g., background and cursor visibility).
- If the cursor is hard to see, try a slightly lighter editor background (e.g., `#24152d`) or adjust the caret color (when available).

---

## üîÆ Roadmap

- BlueJ extension to override areas that CSS can‚Äôt reliably reach (e.g., some cursor and editor behaviors).
- Improved terminal theming.
- More palette variants (e.g., Storm, Night, Moon).

> Some UI elements may be hardcoded in BlueJ and not fully themeable via CSS alone. The planned extension aims to cover these gaps and deliver a 99% complete theme.
> Next I will update those mathod calling windows
