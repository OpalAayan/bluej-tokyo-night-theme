(It's a good idea to back up the original files first!)Restart BlueJ: The new theme will be active when you restart the application.üîÆ Future DevelopmentSome UI elements (like the text cursor and default editor background) are hard-coded into BlueJ's Java source and cannot be changed with CSS. A future Java-based extension is being considered to override these final elements and achieve a 100% complete theme.‚ù§Ô∏è AcknowledgementsA big thanks to Gemini for the assistance in troubleshooting and developing the CSS.This project is open source and licensed under the MIT License.
